It is often said that a Stalker who relies on nothing but an Emergency tank is a fool who plays with stakes far beyond their control. Often these tanks are found with simple straps attached to them or even shoved in pockets to act as a first line of defence for those without access to funding, or wealth of their own. \n

		<text>A rather common multi liters oxygen tank, often found among more experienced stalkers that sport SEVA suits. It is unknown how these tanks manage to appear in the Zone; however it is speculated that they are imported through unknown black market routes. Each tank is coated in a special Zone made coating to keep the apparatus from degrading in the harshest of anomaly fields. The results produced from this coting are rather speculative, though many stalkers still prefer it over a heavier insulation. The tank is rated to provide around three hours of oxygen to a pressurized rig, unlike its heavier Zone found cousin often found in the hands of the Ecologist's expeditions. \n

This gas mask filter is only available in Duty inventories, and is an affordable lightweight option for increased protection in contrast to the bulky oxygen tanks, expensive Ecologist options, and shady merc imports. Certain liberties taken with the M10's original design have resulted in a somewhat increased weight and decreased flow rate as a consequence of the increased protection.\n

In addition to the standard 40mm GOST male thread for attaching to the mask or extension hose, the DP-1 features a GOST threaded female port on the air intake, sealed with a metal cap instead of a rubber plug like other Soviet filters. This second threading was intended for the user to attach a primary filter, as the DP-1 was not designed for CBRN protection. \n

		<text>The R18 filter canister is a Hungarian-made modern 40mm NATO NBC filter originally issued for military purposes. Mainly only used by Mercenaries crossing into the Zone from the outside world through forbidden and heavily irradiated paths. Due to compatability issues, these filters are often discarded in favor of the far more common GOST-compatible type. The Gamma Technical Corporation's R18 NBC filter was designed to meet the relevant criteria specified in the AEP-73 NATO Standard for protection against chemical and biological warfare agents in aerosol, liquid or vapour form, meaning the protection level is high. The main elements, the particle filter and the activated carbon have been selected to provide low respiratory resistance and weight while meeting the requirements of the AEP-73 NATO Standard - however, this filter has already seen much use, therefore it is likely to expire soon. The body of the filter canister is made from aluminium alloy that provides a very robust product, which is corrosion resistant and extremely durable against shocks and impacts. It is fitted with a standard connection thread according to EN 148-1 and STANAG 4155 requirements and is intended to use with a full face mask. Shelflife is 10 years. \n
